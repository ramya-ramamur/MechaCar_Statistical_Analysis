1. Variance of a non-random variable is usually 0. Given this fact, the intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance coeeficients can be said to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. That is to say, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype.
2. The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.08e-08, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05. We are able to reject the null hypothesis because of the extremely small p-value which also indicates that the slope is not 0. 
3.This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.
